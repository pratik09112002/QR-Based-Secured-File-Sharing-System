## 📌 About This Project

This project is a **Secure QR Code-Based File Sharing System** designed to provide a safe way of transferring files using:

✔ AES (Fernet) encryption  
✔ QR code-based access  
✔ Email OTP verification  
✔ One-time download enforcement  
✔ Expiry-controlled access  

It was developed as part of **MCA Semester 2 Mini Project** for NCRD’s Sterling Institute of Management Studies (A+ NAAC Accredited).
